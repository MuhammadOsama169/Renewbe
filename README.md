# Renewbe

Renewbe: A community-driven platform to support local clean energy, save money and help environmental NGOs
Subscribe to use or rent a solar panel in a remote location to support clean energy in your country and save money from your electricity bill. Donate a fraction of your savings to an NGO of your choice, engage with their work and learn more about climate activism. Solarity will show you exactly how your donation and your use of renewable energy impacted the world. It will also help you live a more sustainable life and connect you with a community of fellow solar panel users.
